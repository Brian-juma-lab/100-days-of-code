# 💯 100 Days of Code Challenge — Day 2

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code journey! 🚀  
Every day, I’m committing to code and share at least one project, script, or notebook publicly. This challenge is all about consistency, learning, and growth.

---

## 🔥 My Rules

- I will code at least 1 hour every day for 100 days.  
- I will push daily updates to this repository.  
- I’ll work on a mix of projects: data science, ML, scripting, and web automation.

- I strengthen my skills 🧠  
- I build a strong portfolio 📁  
- I stay accountable and motivated by sharing publicly 🔗
